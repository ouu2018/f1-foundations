This is where the curriculum for our Foundations course will sit!

## Getting Started

When are you are first starting, you want to "clone" this onto your computer.

In your Terminal or Command Line, run the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/codechrysalis/f1-foundations.git
```

## Getting New Lessons

Before every class, we will "push" the latest changes. In other words, we will be adding the day's curriculum. In order to update the copy of this repository on your computer, you will need to run the following:

```bash
git pull origin master
```

## After Each Lesson

After each lesson, you need to run the following commands:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "<YOUR MESSAGE HERE>"
```

A good message could be, "Finished Day 1 functions"
